        <h4>Certainly! Here's a simple recipe for Bhindi Raita:

            Ingredients:
            
            250 grams lady's finger (okra), washed, dried, and thinly sliced
            2 cups yogurt (preferably thick yogurt or Greek yogurt)
            1 tablespoon oil
            1 teaspoon mustard seeds
            1 teaspoon cumin seeds
            1 green chili, finely chopped (optional)
            1/2 teaspoon grated ginger
            1/2 teaspoon roasted cumin powder
            1/4 teaspoon red chili powder (optional, adjust to taste)
            Salt to taste
            Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
            Instructions:
            
            Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Let them splutter.
            
            Add the thinly sliced lady's finger (okra) to the pan. Sauté until they are cooked through and crispy, about 7-10 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.
            
            Once the okra is cooked, add finely chopped green chili and grated ginger to the pan. Sauté for another minute. Remove from heat and let it cool.
            
            In a mixing bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth.
            
            Once the okra mixture has cooled down, add it to the yogurt. Mix well to combine.
            
            Season the raita with roasted cumin powder, red chili powder (if using), and salt. Adjust the seasoning according to your taste.
            
            Garnish the Bhindi Raita with fresh coriander leaves.
            
            Chill the raita in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.
            
            Serve chilled Bhindi Raita as a refreshing side dish with rice dishes like biryani, pulao, or as a dip with Indian bread like roti or paratha.
