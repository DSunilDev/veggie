crisPY bhindi masala


500 grams lady's finger (okra), washed, dried, and slit lengthwise
2 tablespoons gram flour (besan)
2 tablespoons rice flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional)
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon amchur (dry mango) powder
Salt to taste
Oil for frying
For Garnish:

Chaat masala
Chopped fresh coriander leaves
Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, combine gram flour, rice flour, cornstarch (if using), turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, amchur powder, and salt. Mix well.

Add the slit lady's finger to the bowl with the spice mixture. Toss gently to coat the okra evenly with the spices. Ensure that each piece is coated well.

Heat oil for frying in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat.

Once the oil is hot, carefully add the coated lady's finger pieces to the hot oil in batches. Do not overcrowd the pan.

Fry the lady's finger until they turn crispy and golden brown, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking. This should take about 5-7 minutes per batch.

Once crispy and golden brown, remove the fried lady's finger using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.

Repeat the frying process with the remaining batches of coated lady's finger.

Once all the lady's finger batches are fried and drained, transfer them to a serving plate.

Sprinkle some chaat masala and chopped fresh coriander leaves on top for extra flavor and garnish.

Serve the crispy masala bhindi hot as a side dish with dal and rice or as a snack with your favorite chutney or sauce.
