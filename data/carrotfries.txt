Carrot fries are a healthy and tasty alternative to traditional potato fries. They're easy to make and can be seasoned in various ways. Here's a simple recipe for making carrot fries:

Ingredients:
- 4-5 medium-sized carrots, peeled and cut into thin strips (like fries)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or melted coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy cleanup.
2. In a large bowl, toss the carrot strips with olive oil until they are evenly coated.
3. In a small bowl, mix together paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, ground cumin, salt, and pepper.
4. Sprinkle the spice mixture over the carrot strips and toss until they are evenly coated with the spices.
5. Arrange the seasoned carrot strips in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, making sure they're not overcrowded.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the carrot fries are golden brown and crispy on the outside.
7. Once done, remove the carrot fries from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.
8. Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro if desired, and serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce such as ketchup, aioli, or ranch dressing.
