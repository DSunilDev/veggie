Carrot paratha is a delicious and nutritious Indian flatbread made by mixing grated carrots with whole wheat flour and spices. Here's a simple recipe to make carrot paratha:

Ingredients:
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 cup grated carrots
- 1 green chili, finely chopped (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon grated ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- Salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves
- Ghee or oil for cooking

Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine whole wheat flour, grated carrots, green chili, ginger, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, salt, and chopped coriander leaves.
2. Knead everything together into a smooth dough, adding a little water as needed to form a soft dough.
3. Divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls and roll each ball into a smooth round ball.
4. Dust a rolling board with some flour and roll out each ball into a circular disc of about 6-7 inches in diameter.
5. Heat a tawa or skillet over medium heat. Once hot, place a rolled-out paratha on the tawa.
6. Cook the paratha for about a minute on one side until small bubbles start to appear on the surface.
7. Flip the paratha and spread some ghee or oil on the cooked side.
8. Cook the other side for about a minute, pressing lightly with a spatula until both sides are golden brown and cooked through.
9. Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.
10. Serve hot carrot parathas with yogurt, pickle, or any curry of your choice.
