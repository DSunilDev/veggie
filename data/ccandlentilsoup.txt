Carrot and lentil soup is a hearty and nutritious dish that's perfect for a comforting meal. Here's a simple recipe to make it:

Ingredients:
- 1 cup red lentils (masoor dal), rinsed and drained
- 2 cups carrots, peeled and chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
- 4 cups vegetable broth or water
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish (optional)
- Lemon wedges for serving (optional)

Instructions:

1. Heat olive oil or butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
2. Add minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot and saut√© for another minute until fragrant.
3. Stir in ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Cook the spices for about 1 minute to toast them and release their flavors.
4. Add chopped carrots and rinsed red lentils to the pot. Stir well to coat them with the spices.
5. Pour in vegetable broth or water and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes or until the lentils and carrots are tender.
6. Once the lentils and carrots are cooked through, remove the pot from heat. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth and creamy. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until smooth, then return it to the pot.
7. If the soup is too thick, you can add more water or broth to reach your desired consistency.
8. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.
9. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh coriander leaves if desired. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the soup before eating.
