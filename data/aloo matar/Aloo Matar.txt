 Aloo Matar:

Ingredients:
- 3 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen)
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 tomatoes, finely chopped or pureed
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2 green chilies, slit lengthwise (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
- Salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil
- Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish

Instructions:

1. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them crackle.

2. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.

3. Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.

4. Add chopped tomatoes or tomato puree to the pan. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and oil starts to separate from the mixture.

5. Lower the heat and add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.

6. Add diced potatoes and peas to the pan. Stir to coat them with the spice mixture.

7. Pour in enough water to cover the potatoes and peas. Cover the pan with a lid and let it simmer on low heat until the potatoes are tender and cooked through, stirring occasionally. If the mixture becomes too dry, add a little more water.

8. Once the potatoes and peas are cooked, sprinkle garam masala over the top and stir gently to combine.

9. Cook for another couple of minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

10. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve hot with rice, roti, or naan.
