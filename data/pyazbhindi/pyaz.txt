Pyazwali bhindi, also known as okra with onions, is a delicious Indian dish that pairs the unique flavor of okra with the sweetness of onions. Here's a simple recipe for making pyazwali bhindi:

Ingredients:

500 grams lady's finger (okra), washed, dried, and chopped into small pieces
2 large onions, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, chopped
2 green chilies, slit lengthwise
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons oil
Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
Instructions:

Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.

Add sliced onions to the pan and sauté until they turn golden brown.

Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.

Add chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they turn soft and mushy.

Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes until the spices are fragrant.

Add the chopped lady's finger to the pan and mix well with the onion-tomato mixture.

Cover the pan and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lady's finger is cooked through and tender.

Once the lady's finger is cooked, remove the lid and cook for another 5-7 minutes to allow any excess moisture to evaporate and to achieve a dry consistency.

Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.

Serve hot with roti, naan, or rice
