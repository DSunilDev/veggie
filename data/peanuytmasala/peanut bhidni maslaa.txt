Sure! Here's a recipe for Bhindi in Peanut Masala, a delicious and flavorful dish where okra is cooked in a creamy peanut sauce:

Ingredients:

500 grams lady's finger (okra), washed, dried, and sliced into rounds
1/2 cup roasted peanuts
2 tablespoons oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, finely chopped
2 green chilies, slit lengthwise
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
Salt to taste
1/4 cup water
Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
Instructions:

In a blender or food processor, grind the roasted peanuts into a fine powder. Set aside.

Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.

Add finely chopped onion to the pan and sauté until it turns golden brown.

Add ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies to the pan. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.

Add finely chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook until they turn soft and mushy.

Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt to the pan. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes until the spices are fragrant.

Add the sliced lady's finger (okra) to the pan. Mix well with the onion-tomato mixture.

Cook the okra for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add water to the pan, cover, and cook until the okra is tender, about 8-10 minutes.

Once the okra is cooked, add the ground peanut powder to the pan. Mix well to combine.

Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together and the sauce to thicken.

Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.

Serve hot with roti, naan, or rice.
