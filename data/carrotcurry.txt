Here's a simple recipe for making carrot curry:

Ingredients:
- 4-5 medium-sized carrots, peeled and diced
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 tomatoes, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2 green chilies, slit lengthwise (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
- Salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons oil
- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

Instructions:

1. Heat oil in a pan or kadai over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Let them crackle.
2. Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.
3. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
4. Add chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they turn soft and mushy, stirring occasionally.
5. Once the tomatoes are cooked, add turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook the spices for a minute.
6. Add diced carrots to the pan and stir to coat them evenly with the spice mixture.

8. Once the carrots are cooked through, sprinkle garam masala over the curry and mix well.
9. Taste and adjust salt and spices according to your preference.
