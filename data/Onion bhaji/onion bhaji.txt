Onion Bhaji (Onion Fritters):

Ingredients:

2 large onions, thinly sliced
1 cup chickpea flour (besan)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)
Salt to taste
Water, as needed
Oil for deep frying
Instructions:

In a large bowl, combine chickpea flour, baking powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, chili powder, and salt.
Add thinly sliced onions to the flour mixture and toss until well coated.
Gradually add water to the mixture, stirring continuously, until you have a thick batter that coats the onions.
Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat.
Drop spoonfuls of the onion batter into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per batch.
Remove the bhajis from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
Serve hot with your favorite chutney or dipping sauce.
