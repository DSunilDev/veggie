Here's a simple recipe for Aloo Paratha:

Ingredients:

2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)
3 medium-sized potatoes, boiled and mashed
1 green chili, finely chopped (optional)
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves (cilantro)
Ghee or oil for cooking
Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and a pinch of salt. Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth and soft dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.

In another bowl, mix together the mashed potatoes, chopped green chili (if using), grated ginger, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, chopped coriander leaves, and salt. Mix well to combine all the spices with the potatoes.

Divide the dough and the potato mixture into equal-sized portions, shaping them into balls.

Take one portion of the dough and roll it into a small disk, about 3-4 inches in diameter, using a rolling pin and some dry flour for dusting.

Place a portion of the potato mixture in the center of the rolled-out dough.

Gather the edges of the dough to enclose the potato mixture completely, then flatten it gently.

Roll out the stuffed dough ball into a circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter, using a rolling pin and some dry flour for dusting. Be gentle to ensure the filling doesn't come out.

Heat a tawa (griddle) or a non-stick pan over medium heat. Once hot, place the rolled-out paratha on it.

Cook the paratha for about 1-2 minutes on one side until bubbles start to appear on the surface.

Flip the paratha and spread some ghee or oil on the cooked side. Cook for another 1-2 minutes.

Flip again, spread ghee or oil on the other side, and cook until both sides are golden brown and cooked through.

Repeat the process with the remaining dough and potato mixture to make more parathas.

Serve hot Aloo Parathas with yogurt, pickle, or your favorite chutney
