Certainly! Aloo Bhindi Sabzi is a popular Indian dish made with potatoes (aloo) and okra (bhindi), cooked together with spices to create a flavorful and comforting vegetable dish. Here's a simple recipe:

Ingredients:

250 grams lady's finger (okra), washed, dried, and sliced into rounds
2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced into small cubes
2 tablespoons oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, finely chopped
2 green chilies, slit lengthwise
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
Salt to taste
Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
Instructions:

Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.

Add finely chopped onion to the pan and sauté until it turns golden brown.

Add ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies to the pan. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.

Add finely chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook until they turn soft and mushy.

Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt to the pan. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes until the spices are fragrant.

Add diced potatoes to the pan. Mix well with the onion-tomato mixture.

Once the potatoes are partially cooked, add the sliced lady's finger (okra) to the pan. Mix well with the potato mixture.

Cover the pan again and cook for another 10-12 minutes or until the potatoes and okra are tender, stirring occasionally.

Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
