Pickled carrots are a delicious and tangy condiment that can add flavor and crunch to salads, sandwiches, tacos, and more. Here's a simple recipe to make pickled carrots at home:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups carrots, peeled and cut into thin strips or rounds
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup white vinegar
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
- 1 bay leaf (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes (optional, for heat)

Instructions:

1. Prepare the carrots by peeling them and cutting them into thin strips or rounds. Pack the carrot strips tightly into clean, sterilized jars, leaving about 1/2 inch of space at the top.

2. In a small saucepan, combine water, vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic cloves, black peppercorns, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, bay leaf (if using), and red chili flakes (if using). Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar and salt are dissolved.

3. Once the brine mixture comes to a boil, remove it from the heat and carefully pour it over the packed carrots in the jars, ensuring that the carrots are completely submerged in the liquid.

4. Let the jars cool to room temperature before sealing them tightly with lids. Then, transfer the jars to the refrigerator and let the pickled carrots marinate for at least 24 hours before serving.

5. The pickled carrots will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 weeks. The longer they sit, the more the flavors will develop.

6. Serve the pickled carrots as a tangy and crunchy addition to salads, sandwiches, tacos, burgers, or as a garnish for various dishes.
