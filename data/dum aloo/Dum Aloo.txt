 Dum Aloo:

Ingredients:

500g baby potatoes, boiled and peeled
1 cup plain yogurt (curd)
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, pureed
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1-inch ginger, grated
2-3 green chilies, slit
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder (or paprika for less heat)
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons cooking oil
Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish
Instructions:

1.
Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them crackle.

2. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.

3. Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.

Stir in the tomato puree and cook until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.

Lower the heat and add turmeric powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, ground coriander, ground cumin, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.

Whisk the yogurt until smooth and then add it to the pan. Mix well to combine.

Add the boiled baby potatoes and slit green chilies to the pan. Stir gently to coat the potatoes with the gravy.

Cover the pan with a lid and let the potatoes simmer in the gravy on low heat for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

Once the potatoes are tender and the gravy has thickened, sprinkle garam masala over the top and stir gently.

Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve hot with rice, roti, or naan.
